# ImageRecognition
This project focuses on image recognition using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The repository includes a notebook containing the main code, a CSV dataset of labeled images used for training or comparison, and a sample image file for recognition. To recognize a different image, simply change the path to the desired image in the code before execution. This ensures the model or logic processes the correct input and returns accurate results based on the dataset provided.
